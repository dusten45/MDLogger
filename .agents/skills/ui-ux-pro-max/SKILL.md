# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Searchable database of UI/UX design rules with priority-based recommendations: 84 styles, 192 color palettes, 74 font pairings, 192 product types with reasoning rules, 98 UX guidelines, 104 icon entries, 16 GSAP motion presets, and 25 chart types across 22 technology stacks.

## When to Apply

Use this Skill when the task involves **UI structure, visual design decisions, interaction patterns, or user experience quality control**: designing new pages, creating/refactoring UI components, choosing color/typography/spacing/layout systems, reviewing UI for UX/accessibility/consistency, implementing navigation/animation/responsive behavior, or improving perceived quality and usability.

Skip it for pure backend logic, API/database design, non-visual performance work, infrastructure/DevOps, or non-visual scripts — unless the task changes how something **looks, feels, moves, or is interacted with**.

## MDLogger Project Adapter

This repository is a Python 3.13, PySide6, and pyqtgraph Windows desktop application. The product's primary UX goal is rapid match logging immediately after the user switches from a game with Alt+Tab.

Apply these constraints before any generic recommendation:

- Preserve the existing result-selection → detail-entry → save workflow unless the user explicitly requests a behavior change.
- Implement UI changes with PySide6 widgets, Qt layouts, palettes, properties, and Qt Style Sheets (QSS).
- Never add React, Tailwind, JavaScript, a browser runtime, or a web view solely for a visual improvement.
- Translate CSS design tokens into shared Python constants or application-level QSS; translate Flexbox/Grid concepts into Qt layouts.
- Treat web-specific guidance such as DOM, ARIA, viewport, CSS breakpoints, WebP, and GSAP as conceptual only. Use the equivalent Qt accessibility, focus, sizing, and interaction behavior where applicable.
- Support Korean text, long deck names, keyboard navigation, visible focus states, and Windows DPI scaling at 100%, 125%, and 150%.
- Preserve large, fast click targets. Do not trade input speed for decorative animation or visual novelty.
- Never communicate win/loss, selection, validation, or chart meaning through color alone.
- Prefer the existing dependencies and native Qt capabilities. Follow `AGENTS.md` and run its required validation after Python changes.
- PySide6 is not one of the bundled stack datasets. Use product, style, color, typography, UX, icons, and chart searches, then translate the results to Qt. Do not default this project to `html-tailwind`.

## Rule Categories by Priority

*Follow priority 1→10 to decide which category to focus on first; use `--domain <Domain>` to query full details. The full rule text for every category lives in `references/quick-reference.md` — read it on demand rather than loading it every time.*

| Priority | Category | Impact | Domain | Key Checks (Must Have) | Anti-Patterns (Avoid) |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Accessibility | CRITICAL | `ux` | Contrast 4.5:1, Alt text, Keyboard nav, Aria-labels | Removing focus rings, Icon-only buttons without labels |
| 2 | Touch & Interaction | CRITICAL | `ux` | Min size 44×44px, 8px+ spacing, Loading feedback | Reliance on hover only, Instant state changes (0ms) |
| 3 | Performance | HIGH | `ux` | WebP/AVIF, Lazy loading, Reserve space (CLS &lt; 0.1) | Layout thrashing, Cumulative Layout Shift |
| 4 | Style Selection | HIGH | `style`, `product` | Match product type, Consistency, SVG icons (no emoji) | Mixing flat & skeuomorphic randomly, Emoji as icons |
| 5 | Layout & Responsive | HIGH | `ux` | Mobile-first breakpoints, Viewport meta, No horizontal scroll | Horizontal scroll, Fixed px container widths, Disable zoom |
| 6 | Typography & Color | MEDIUM | `typography`, `color` | Base 16px, Line-height 1.5, Semantic color tokens | Text &lt; 12px body, Gray-on-gray, Raw hex in components |
| 7 | Animation | MEDIUM | `ux`, `gsap` | Duration 150–300ms, Motion conveys meaning, Spatial continuity | Decorative-only animation, Animating width/height, No reduced-motion |
| 8 | Forms & Feedback | MEDIUM | `ux` | Visible labels, Error near field, Helper text, Progressive disclosure | Placeholder-only label, Errors only at top, Overwhelm upfront |
| 9 | Navigation Patterns | HIGH | `ux` | Predictable back, Bottom nav ≤5, Deep linking | Overloaded nav, Broken back behavior, No deep links |
| 10 | Charts & Data | LOW | `chart` | Legends, Tooltips, Accessible colors | Relying on color alone to convey meaning |

For the full rule list per category (all ~98 UX guidelines with rationale), read `references/quick-reference.md`. For app-specific polish rules (icons, touch feedback, dark mode contrast, safe areas) and the canonical pre-delivery checklist, read `references/pro-rules.md`.

## Running the search tool

The search script is project-local. Run it from the MDCalculator project root using the checked-in path below. If the current working directory is uncertain, locate the project root before invoking it:

```bash
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<query>" --domain <domain>
```

If `python` is not found, try `python3`, then `py -3`. Requires Python 3.x, no external dependencies (see README for install instructions if Python is missing).

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract from the user request:
- **Product type**: SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, dashboard, entertainment, tool, productivity, or hybrid
- **Target audience & context**: age group, usage context (commute, leisure, work)
- **Style keywords**: playful, vibrant, minimal, dark mode, content-first, immersive, etc.
- **Stack**: detect from the project. For MDLogger, `pyproject.toml` and imports identify PySide6; apply the MDLogger Project Adapter and do not run a bundled `--stack` search. For other projects, check `package.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, `*.xcodeproj`/`Package.swift`, `composer.json`, or React Native markers. If nothing is detectable, ask the user rather than silently defaulting to `html-tailwind`. **Never assume a stack** — a hardcoded default silently misroutes every recommendation.

### Step 2: Generate Design System (REQUIRED for new pages/projects)

Always start with `--design-system` to get comprehensive recommendations with reasoning:

```bash
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<product_type> <industry> <keywords>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"]
```

This searches product/style/color/landing/typography domains in parallel, applies reasoning rules from `ui-reasoning.csv`, and returns pattern, style, colors, typography, effects, and anti-patterns to avoid.

**Example:**
```bash
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "beauty spa wellness service" --design-system -p "Serenity Spa"
```

### Step 2b: Persist Design System (Master + Overrides Pattern)

To save the design system for retrieval across sessions, add `--persist` **and always pass `--output-dir` pointed at the project root** — without it, files are written relative to whatever directory the tool happens to run from:

```bash
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<query>" --design-system --persist -p "Project Name" --output-dir "<project-root>"
```

This creates:
- `design-system/<project-slug>/MASTER.md` — Global Source of Truth
- `design-system/<project-slug>/pages/` — Folder for page-specific overrides

With a page-specific override, add `--page "dashboard"` to also create `design-system/<project-slug>/pages/dashboard.md`.

If `design-system/<project-slug>/MASTER.md` already exists, `--persist` **skips writing and leaves it untouched** unless you also pass `--force` — check whether it exists first (and read it) before regenerating, so you don't silently discard prior decisions the user or a teammate made.

**Retrieval when building a specific page:**
1. Read `design-system/<project-slug>/MASTER.md`
2. Check if `design-system/<project-slug>/pages/<page-name>.md` exists — if so, its rules override Master
3. Otherwise use Master rules exclusively

### Step 2c: Design Dials (optional)

Three optional 1-10 sliders that tune `--design-system` output without changing your query. Add any combination of them to the same command:

```bash
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<query>" --design-system --variance <1-10> --motion <1-10> --density <1-10>
```

| Dial | Low (1-3) | Mid (4-7) | High (8-10) |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `--variance` | Centered / minimal (biases toward Minimalism-style categories) | Balanced / modern | Bold / asymmetric (biases toward Brutalism, Bento Grids) |
| `--motion` | Subtle micro-interactions | Standard scroll/stagger motion | Complex choreography (pin, Flip, SplitText) |
| `--density` | Spacious (24-96px spacing scale) | Standard (16-64px, current default) | Dense/dashboard (8-32px spacing scale) |

- `--motion` attaches a ready-to-use GSAP snippet (with framework notes, Do/Don't, and performance notes) pulled from `--domain gsap`, matched to the resolved tier (Subtle/Standard/Complex).
- `--density` overrides the `--space-*` CSS variable table in the ASCII/markdown/MASTER.md output — use it for dashboards (high) vs. marketing pages (low) without hand-editing tokens.
- Leaving a dial unset keeps that part of the output exactly as it was before (no behavior change).

**Example:**
```bash
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "internal analytics dashboard" --design-system --variance 8 --motion 7 --density 8 -p "Ops Console"
```

### Step 3: Supplement with Detailed Searches (as needed)

```bash
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

| Need | Domain | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Product type patterns | `product` | `--domain product "entertainment social"` |
| More style options | `style` | `--domain style "glassmorphism dark"` |
| Color palettes | `color` | `--domain color "entertainment vibrant"` |
| Font pairings | `typography` | `--domain typography "playful modern"` |
| Individual Google Fonts | `google-fonts` | `--domain google-fonts "sans serif popular variable"` |
| Chart recommendations | `chart` | `--domain chart "real-time dashboard"` |
| UX best practices | `ux` | `--domain ux "animation accessibility"` |
| Landing page structure | `landing` | `--domain landing "hero social-proof"` |
| Icon recommendations | `icons` | `--domain icons "navigation outline"` |
| GSAP animation presets | `gsap` | `--domain gsap "scroll reveal stagger"` |
| React/Next.js performance | `react` | `--domain react "rerender memo list"` |
| App/native interface guidelines | `web` | `--domain web "accessibilityLabel touch safe-areas"` |

Domain is auto-detected from the query if `--domain` is omitted — but auto-detection can misroute overlapping terms (e.g. "font" matches both `typography` and `google-fonts`). If results look off-topic, pass `--domain` explicitly.

### Step 4: Stack Guidelines

```bash
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "<keyword>" --stack <stack>
```

**Available stacks:** `react`, `nextjs`, `vue`, `svelte`, `astro`, `nuxtjs`, `nuxt-ui`, `angular`, `laravel`, `swiftui`, `react-native`, `flutter`, `jetpack-compose`, `html-tailwind`, `shadcn`, `threejs`, `javafx`, `wpf`, `winui`, `avalonia`, `uno`, `uwp`. Use the stack detected in Step 1. For MDLogger, skip `--stack` because PySide6 is unsupported; use the general design domains and translate recommendations according to the project adapter.

---

## If a search returns 0 results

Do not fabricate output. Instead:
1. Retry once with broader or differently-worded keywords (try product + style separately rather than combined).
2. If still empty, fall back to the priority table above and say explicitly to the user that this recommendation came from the built-in defaults, not a database match (e.g. "no palette match for X, using general SaaS defaults").
3. Never present a 0-result search as if it returned data.

## Example Workflow

**User request:** "Make an AI search homepage." (stack detected as Next.js from `package.json`)

```bash
# Step 2: design system
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "AI search tool modern minimal" --design-system -p "AI Search"

# Step 3: supplement
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "search loading animation" --domain ux

# Step 4: stack guidelines
python ".agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py" "suspense streaming bundle" --stack nextjs
```

Then synthesize the design system + detailed searches and implement.

## Output Formats

`--design-system` supports `-f ascii` (default, terminal display), `-f markdown` (documentation), and `--json` (machine-readable, includes the raw design system dict plus persistence status).

## Tips for Better Results

- Use **multi-dimensional keywords** — combine product + industry + tone + density: `"entertainment social vibrant content-dense"`, not just `"app"`
- Try different phrasings for the same need: `"playful neon"` → `"vibrant dark"` → `"content-first minimal"`
- Use `--design-system` first for full recommendations, then `--domain` to deep-dive any dimension you're unsure about
- Pass the detected stack explicitly for implementation-specific guidance

| Problem | What to Do |
|---------|------------|
| Can't decide on style/color | Re-run `--design-system` with different keywords |
| Dark mode contrast issues | `references/quick-reference.md` §6: `color-dark-mode` + `color-accessible-pairs` |
| Animations feel unnatural | `references/quick-reference.md` §7: `spring-physics` + `easing` + `exit-faster-than-enter` |
| Form UX is poor | `references/quick-reference.md` §8: `inline-validation` + `error-clarity` + `focus-management` |
| Navigation feels confusing | `references/quick-reference.md` §9: `nav-hierarchy` + `bottom-nav-limit` + `back-behavior` |
| Layout breaks on small screens | `references/quick-reference.md` §5: `mobile-first` + `breakpoint-consistency` |
| Performance / jank | `references/quick-reference.md` §3: `virtualize-lists` + `main-thread-budget` + `debounce-throttle` |

## Before Delivering App UI

Read `references/pro-rules.md` and run through its canonical Pre-Delivery Checklist. Translate its native/mobile guidance to Qt desktop behavior: keyboard focus and tab order, accessible names, hover/pressed/disabled states, Windows DPI scaling, Korean text fit, color-independent status cues, and chart legibility. Ignore mobile-only safe-area and gesture rules unless the target actually requires them.
